## Types of Data Structure

- Linear data structure
  - The data items are arranged in sequential order, one after the other.
  - All the items are present on the single layer.
  - It can be traversed on a single run. That is, if we start from the first element, we can traverse all the elements sequentially in a single pass.
  - The memory utilization is not efficient.
  - The time complexity increase with the data size.
  - Example: Arrays, Stack, Queue, Linked List

- Non-linear data structure
  - The data items are arranged in non-sequential order (hierarchical manner).
  - The data items are present at different layers.
  - It requires multiple runs. That is, if we start from the first element it might not be possible to traverse all the elements in a single pass.
  - Different structures utilize memory in different efficient ways depending on the need.
  - Time complexity remains the same.
  - Example: Tree, Graph
